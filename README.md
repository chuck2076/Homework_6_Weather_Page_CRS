# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## My Task

 My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I am using the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Things I was able to accomplish in time:
1. I have created a weather dashboard with search input forms.

2. When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current a current forecast as well as a 5 Day Forecast for that city.

3. Current weather conditions show the city name, the date, an icon represenation of weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

4. The 5 Day Forecast displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed and humidity.

Things I was not able to accomplish in time:

1. Display the UV index.  For some reason, whenever I tried to display the index it came up as null and broke the code, even though console log showed it with a value. I had to pull a Black Widow and sacrifice it for the sake of the team.

2. Being a project week, I just plain ran out of time to code out local storage for the past search buttons. Maybe I'll get to it before the end of the Boot Camp.

```
